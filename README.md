# Fundamentals of Generative AI - Assignment 01


## QUESTION-1 
    Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI):
AI is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches to make machines "intelligent."

**Machine Learning (ML):**
Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML models learn from examples and improve their performance over time. For instance, ML can be used to predict stock prices or classify emails as spam.

**Deep Learning:**
Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that employs neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These networks are designed to automatically extract features from raw data, making them particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding. Deep learning models require large amounts of data and computational power to train.

**Generative AI:**
Generative AI refers to models that can generate new data or content that resembles the training data. Unlike traditional models that classify or predict, generative AI creates new examples, such as images, text, or audio. Examples include generative adversarial networks (GANs) and certain types of deep learning models that create realistic images or text.

**Applied AI:**
Applied AI refers to the practical implementation of AI technologies to solve real-world problems. It involves applying AI, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to specific domains like healthcare, finance, or transportation. Applied AI focuses on developing solutions and tools that leverage AI to address industry-specific challenges and improve processes or outcomes.

## Training and Inference in AI:
### Training:
Training is the process of teaching an AI model to recognize patterns and make predictions by exposing it to large amounts of data. During training, the model learns to map input data to the correct outputs by adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases) based on the error between its predictions and the actual results. This process involves several key steps:

**1-Data Collection:** Gathering and preparing the dataset.

**2-Model Selection:** Choosing the appropriate algorithm or neural network architecture.

**3-Forward Pass:** Feeding input data through the model to obtain predictions.

**4-Loss Calculation:** Comparing predictions to the actual outcomes to calculate the error (loss).

**4-Backpropagation:** Adjusting model parameters to minimize the error using optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent).

**5-Iteration:** Repeating the forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation for multiple epochs until the model converges. 

### Inference:
Inference is the process of using a trained AI model to make predictions on new, unseen data. During inference, the model applies the patterns and knowledge it learned during training to new inputs to generate predictions or classifications. Inference typically involves:

**1-Loading the Trained Model:** Using the trained model's parameters for predictions.

**2-Forward Pass:** Feeding new input data through the model to obtain predictions.

**3-Output Generation:** Producing results based on the model's predictions.

## QUESTION-4
    Describe neural networks, including an explanation of parameters and tokens.

## Neural Networks Overview

## Introduction

Neural networks are a fundamental component of artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain and are used to model complex patterns and relationships in data. This README provides an overview of neural networks, including key concepts such as parameters and tokens.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers. The basic structure of a neural network includes:

- **Input Layer**: Receives the input data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations and transform the input data through weighted connections.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final output or prediction.



### Parameters

Parameters in a neural network are the weights and biases that the network learns during training. They are crucial for the network to make accurate predictions. Here's a brief explanation:

- **Weights**: These are the coefficients for the connections between neurons in adjacent layers. Each connection has an associated weight that determines the strength and direction of the influence of one neuron on another. During training, the network adjusts these weights to minimize the error in its predictions.

- **Biases**: Each neuron has an associated bias that allows the model to shift the activation function and help the network learn more complex patterns. Biases are added to the weighted sum of inputs before applying the activation function.

### Tokens

In the context of natural language processing (NLP) and certain neural network applications, tokens are units of text that the model processes. Tokens can be:

- **Words**: Individual words in a sentence.
- **Subwords**: Parts of words or morphemes that can be useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words or complex words.
- **Characters**: Individual characters of text.

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into these tokens. This allows neural networks, especially those used in NLP tasks, to process and understand text data more effectively.

## Hallucinations in LLMs

Hallucinations refer to instances where LLMs generate outputs that are incorrect, nonsensical, or not grounded in the training data. These can manifest as made-up facts, irrelevant information, or inconsistent responses.

### Causes of Hallucinations:

- **Training Data**: LLMs are trained on diverse datasets that may contain erroneous or misleading information. The model might generate outputs based on these inaccuracies.
- **Model Overfitting**: Overfitting to the training data can cause the model to produce responses based on memorized patterns rather than actual understanding.

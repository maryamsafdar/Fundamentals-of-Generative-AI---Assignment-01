# Fundamentals of Generative AI - Assignment 01


## QUESTION-1 
    Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI):
AI is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches to make machines "intelligent."

**Machine Learning (ML):**
Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML models learn from examples and improve their performance over time. For instance, ML can be used to predict stock prices or classify emails as spam.

**Deep Learning:**
Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that employs neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These networks are designed to automatically extract features from raw data, making them particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding. Deep learning models require large amounts of data and computational power to train.

**Generative AI:**
Generative AI refers to models that can generate new data or content that resembles the training data. Unlike traditional models that classify or predict, generative AI creates new examples, such as images, text, or audio. Examples include generative adversarial networks (GANs) and certain types of deep learning models that create realistic images or text.

**Applied AI:**
Applied AI refers to the practical implementation of AI technologies to solve real-world problems. It involves applying AI, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to specific domains like healthcare, finance, or transportation. Applied AI focuses on developing solutions and tools that leverage AI to address industry-specific challenges and improve processes or outcomes.

****QUESTION-2:****
   Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and outline the five steps to achieve super-intelligence.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a form of artificial intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to or surpassing that of human intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks (e.g., image recognition or natural language processing), AGI aims to exhibit cognitive abilities that are not limited to predefined functions. AGI would be capable of generalizing knowledge and adapting to new situations, making it versatile and adaptable across various domains.

1- Chatbots:
Role: Start by developing advanced chatbots that utilize sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in a more human-like manner. These chatbots should be capable of understanding context, maintaining coherent conversations, and providing meaningful responses.
Goal: Lay the groundwork for more complex systems by enhancing the ability of AI to handle human language and interaction.

2- Reasoners:
Role: Build reasoners that can perform logical reasoning and complex decision-making. These systems should be able to analyze data, make inferences, and solve problems by applying rules and logic.
Goal: Develop AI with the ability to understand and reason about complex scenarios, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities and intelligence.

3- Agents:
Role: Create autonomous agents that can act and make decisions in dynamic environments. These agents should be capable of learning from interactions, adapting to new situations, and performing tasks without constant human oversight.
Goal: Achieve a higher level of autonomy and adaptability, enabling AI to operate in a broader range of real-world applications.

4- Innovators:
Role: Encourage and develop innovative AI systems that push the boundaries of current technology. These systems should be designed to explore new solutions, discover novel approaches, and drive advancements in AI research.
Goal: Foster creativity and innovation in AI to push towards more advanced and intelligent systems.

5-Organizations:
Role: Establish organizations focused on advancing AI research, development, and implementation. These organizations should facilitate collaboration among researchers, engineers, and policymakers to ensure that AI technologies are developed responsibly and ethically.
Goal: Create a structured environment that supports the growth and ethical deployment of AI technologies, ensuring that advancements contribute positively to society.

QUESTION-3:
   Explain the concepts of training and inference in AI, and describe how GPUs or neural engines are utilized for these tasks.
